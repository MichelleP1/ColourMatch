This is a copy of the code I wrote using Android Studio to run the game on my phone and using the programs emulator.

This was created before I learned how to use GitHub, so for now I have just copied my code to a txt file.

It's a game similar to tetris, where the players goal is to keep blocks from stacking up to the top of the screen. This is done by eliminating blocks by matching their colours.
